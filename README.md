1. leetcode 234 - Palindrome Linked List. There are two ways. The first one is finding(via two pointers) the middle of the list and then reversing the former. The other one is using recursion, which will not destroy the origin structure of the list but it's space complexity will not be constant.
2. leetcode 303 - A very good question about dynamic programming! The first time when I meet LC 303, I didn't realize dp could be used in this way.
3. leetcode 304 - Pay attention to the boarder condition!
