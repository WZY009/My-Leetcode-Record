1. leetcode 25 - Reverse Nodes in K-Group: It's little tricky for setting the parameters. The sencond node can not be reached

1. leetcode 234 - Palindrome Linked List. There are two ways. The first one is finding(via two pointers) the middle of the list and then reversing the former. The other one is using recursion, which will not destroy the origin structure of the list but it's space complexity will not be constant.
2. leetcode 303 - A very good question about dynamic programming! The first time when I meet LC 303, I didn't realize dp could be used in this way.
3. leetcode 304 - Pay attention to the boarder condition!
#### 4.27
1. leetcode 560 - First, you should know how to use preSum array to reduce the time complexity(although it still fails to AC). Then, you can use hashmap to store nums[j], which will reduce time complexity for another time.
2. leetcode 370 - Difference array is the opposite form of preSum array. But both of them can reduce time complexity and show the essence of dynamic programming!
